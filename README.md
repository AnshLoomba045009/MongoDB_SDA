Overview
The provided dashboard visualizes weather data using several metrics, offering insights into relationships between weather parameters such as rainfall, temperature, wind, sunshine, and humidity. Below, we analyze the questions, the analytical process, and the managerial insights derived from the visualizations.

1. Questions Asked for Developing This Dashboard
Average Rainfall Across Locations

Which locations experience the highest average rainfall?
How does rainfall distribution vary across cities?
Temperature Range

What are the maximum and minimum temperature trends over time?
Are there seasonal or periodic fluctuations in temperature patterns?
Wind Gust Analysis

What is the relationship between wind gust speed and sunshine hours?
Do higher wind gust speeds correlate with specific weather conditions?
Humidity vs. Temperature

How does temperature variation affect humidity levels at 3 PM?
Are there identifiable thresholds where humidity increases/decreases significantly?
Cloud Cover vs. Pressure

What is the relationship between atmospheric pressure and cloud cover?
Do certain pressure levels lead to higher cloud coverage?
Rainfall vs. Sunshine

How does rainfall correlate with sunshine duration?
Do higher rainfall amounts result in reduced sunshine hours?
Wind Speed Comparison

How do wind speeds at 9 AM and 3 PM compare across different locations?
Are certain cities more prone to higher wind speeds at specific times?
2. Analytical Process
Data Aggregation

Data was grouped by relevant categories such as location, time of day, and weather parameters (e.g., rainfall, temperature, wind gust speed).
Averages, sums, and counts were calculated to summarize the data.
Data Visualization

Bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and line graphs were used to visualize trends and relationships between variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis

Relationships (e.g., correlations between rainfall and sunshine) were analyzed.
Patterns and anomalies, such as extreme wind gust speeds or temperature drops, were identified.
3. Managerial Insights
Rainfall Distribution

Insight: Canberra experiences the highest rainfall among the analyzed locations. Resource allocation for water management in high-rainfall areas like Canberra should be prioritized.
Actionable Decision: Deploy infrastructure for better flood management in high-rainfall zones.
Temperature Trends

Insight: A clear decline in maximum and minimum temperatures over the years suggests possible climate change impacts or seasonal shifts.
Actionable Decision: Plan for energy needs accordingly (e.g., heating during colder months).
Wind Gust and Sunshine

Insight: High wind gust speeds are not strongly correlated with reduced sunshine, indicating that windy conditions may not heavily impact solar energy generation.
Actionable Decision: Continue investing in solar energy, even in windy locations.
Humidity vs. Temperature

Insight: Temperature drops significantly affect humidity levels, which may impact industries relying on specific humidity conditions (e.g., agriculture, manufacturing).
Actionable Decision: Adjust irrigation schedules or storage methods in response to expected humidity changes.
Cloud Cover vs. Pressure

Insight: Lower atmospheric pressure is associated with increased cloud cover, often indicating the potential for rainfall.
Actionable Decision: Use pressure readings as an early indicator for rainfall and alert relevant sectors (e.g., logistics).
Rainfall vs. Sunshine

Insight: Sunshine hours reduce significantly as rainfall increases, which may impact solar energy production or tourism.
Actionable Decision: Plan solar power storage to account for reduced sunlight during heavy rain periods.
Wind Speed Comparison

Insight: Coastal locations like Gold Coast experience higher wind speeds, particularly in the afternoon. Inland cities tend to have lower average wind speeds.
Actionable Decision: Focus wind energy projects in coastal areas with consistently high wind speeds.
Conclusion
The dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of weather data, enabling targeted strategies for industries like energy, agriculture, and infrastructure. By identifying key trends and correlations, managers can make data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency and adapt to environmental changes.
